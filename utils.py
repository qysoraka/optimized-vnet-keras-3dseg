class ModelAndWeightsCheckpoint(Callback):
    """Save the model after every epoch.
    `filepath` can contain named formatting options,
    which will be filled with the values of `epoch` and
    keys in `logs` (passed in `on_epoch_end`).
    For example: if `filepath` is `weights.{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.2f}.hdf5`,
    then the model checkpoints will be saved with the epoch number and
    the validation loss in the filename.
    # Arguments
        filepath: string, path to save the model file.
        monitor: quantity to monitor.
        verbose: verbosity mode, 0 or 1.
        save_best_only: if `save_best_only=True`,
            the latest best model according to
            the quantity monitored will not be overwritten.
        mode: one of {auto, min, max}.
            If `save_best_only=True`, the decision
            to overwrite the current save file is made
            based on either the maximization or the
            minimization of the monitored quantity. For `val_acc`,
            this should be `max`, for `val_loss` this should
            be `min`, etc. In `auto` mode, the direction is
            automatically inferred from the name of the monitored quantity.
        period: Interval (number of epochs) between checkpoints.
